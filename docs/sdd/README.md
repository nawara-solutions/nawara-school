# Software Design Documents (SDD)

An SDD describes the internal design of **one module or service**, one level deeper than an
[ADD](../add) — the audience is the engineer(s) about to build or maintain that module, not
someone trying to understand the whole system.

## What goes in an SDD

- Data model / schema for the module
- Key classes/interfaces and their responsibilities
- Sequence diagrams for its important flows
- The API contract it exposes (and the contracts it consumes from others)
- Error handling and edge cases at the design level

## What doesn't

- Cross-service architecture — that's an [`add/`](../add) doc
- Step-by-step implementation/file-by-file plan for a single feature — that's a
  [`tdd/`](../tdd) doc
- The _why_ behind a specific technical choice made while designing this module — that's an
  [`adr/`](../adr) entry, linked from here

## Naming

```
service-or-module-name.md
```

One SDD per module/service, e.g. `booking-service.md`, `auth-service.md`. Like ADDs, these
are living documents revised in place as the module's design evolves.

## Workflow

1. Copy [`template.md`](./template.md) to `service-or-module-name.md`.
2. Write it before (or alongside) building the module — it's a design tool, not documentation
   written after the fact.
3. Get it reviewed before implementation starts.
4. Update it when the module's design changes materially; trivial implementation details
   don't need to be reflected here.
